Having finished my summer internship at Cambustion in Cambridge, I thoroughly enjoyed my eight weeks in the office, during which I developed software tools to automate calibration procedures that adhere to international standards. I would like to express my gratitude to Julie Pongetti, my supervisor, for her support. I was able to learn a great deal about the practical applications and principles behind aerosol instrumentation from her expert knowledge. I am also very thankful for the warm welcome I received from the entire team, and their devoted time to helping me develop my skills. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of practical lab work, including instrument troubleshooting and uncertainty analysis.
As I enter my third year of studies, my experience at Cambustion has solidified my choice to pursue all thermofluid modules, as well as fourth-year courses in combustion and fluid dynamics.

I was later invited to the company Christmas dinner, and went on to work with them over my Christmas break into the new year. This involved extending the software to include low concentration calibration.
