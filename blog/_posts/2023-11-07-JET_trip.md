Lucy Cavenish College Engineering Society organised trip to JET (Joint European Torus) in Culham, Oxfordshire.
A total of 37 students attended, with some from Downing and Emmanuel Colleges Engineering Societies.

As Treasurer, I organised transport and sourced funding for Lucy students from our colleges STEMM support fund.

The day started with a presentation on the history of JET and the science behind nuclear fusion.
We were then taken on a tour of the facility, including the control room, the RACE (Remote Applications in Challenging Environments) building and a replica of the toka-mak.
Unfortunately, we were unable to see the actual toka-mak as tests were being run on it at the time.
