Design and Technology GCSE Coursework Project

Initial design made from sheet metal and extruded aluminium. The thin aluminium sheet will probably not be strong enough for someone to sit on. The designs I researched could do this because there was a corrugated pattern underneath that reinforced it. Corner struts are bulky and wont really add much support and also make the design overly complicated which will take longer to build. To make the design simpler, instead of the extrudes I will use a cheaper stock square tube for the legs.

Final design decided from sheet metal and extruded aluminium and a stronger top made from Iroko wood

During assembly, the aluminium parts and the hinges were cut on a bansaw and then marked out, holes were center punched and drilled. The wood was planed, cut to size and then glued together by dovetail joints. Two holes were drilled in each wood half and then joined using a router and a jig. The aluminium parts and hinges were then riveted together and lastly, the wood was epoxied and screwed to the piano hinge. Lastly, the two wooden halves were screwed into hinges on each side of the stool. The finished stool can be seen below
