This is a project I started to learn about image processing and computer vision. I wanted to make a ball balancer that would keep a ball on a plate. However, this was before I had any understanding of control theory and so the project was not very successful. However I did learn a lot about image processing, computer vision and serial communcation between the computer and arduino.
