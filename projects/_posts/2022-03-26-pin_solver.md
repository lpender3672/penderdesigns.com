A pin-jointed truss solver thats quick and easy to use.
This project was started in 2022 to save time doing structures in parts 1A and 1B of the cambridge engineering course. However, its only recently been updated enough to be useful.

## Features
* Controls as shown
* Cursor snapping similar to CAD software makes it easy to draw members at common angles
* Selectable members, pins, forces and constraints for editing
* Detection of mechanism and overconstrained structures

## Future work
* deflection solving and displaying
* polish and implement snapping to 30 and 45 degree lines
* surd representation for 30 and 45 degree members
* Adding moments to pins

## Extension for statically indeterminate structures
* force method of IB structures course
* FEM
