Work in progress 3D Printer made from original drawing machine

# Adding 3rd axis to drawing machine

## 4 screw design
The 3D printed material under the weight of the heated plate could deflect much more than the nozzle height.
For this reason I thought it would be best if all 4 corners were supported.
The design shown below shows that with 4 threads all connected by a belt to a motor.

This design was a big failure though as the belt kept slipping.
Despite using a stronger belt tensioner, friction and small manufacturing deviations in thread positions
still meant that there was more torque required than could be transferred by the belt.

## Change to a single thread
A single thread, with slider bearings on one side has worse deflection, however it reduces
the problems mentioned earlier with friction deviations in the thread positions.
