## Introduction

Heat exchangers have a wide range of applications in HVAC, power
generation and chemical industries. These essential components are
typically much larger than other components in a system and can
significantly contribute to the overall cost. Designing high
performance, low cost heat exchangers involves solving complex
optimization problems with multiple constraints.
The software is developed in Python and implements Kerns, LMTD and NTU methods to solve
for heat exchanger performance.


### Objectives

-   To analyse pressure loss and heat transfer for various shell and
    tube heat exchanger designs.

-   To produce a software tool for constrained design optimization of
    shell and tube heat exchangers.

-   To select an optimal design to be compared with other groups designs
    and software tools.

-   To manufacture and test the selected design against other groups and
    software predictions.

## Performance Characterisation

### Hydraulic Analysis

The pressure drop across for each section of the heat exchanger can be
calculated from the mass flow rate and the geometry of the components
through empirical relations. The compressor characteristics in the
closed loop circuit relate the equivilent pressure drop for a given mass
flow rate. This is iteratively solved to calculate the mass flow rate
for a heat exchanger design and compressor characteristic.

The pressure drop in shell side flow is more complex than the tube side
flow due to bundle pass and baffle configurations. Kerns method was used
to calculate the pressure drop in each cold flow pass. This uses an
effective diameter which depends on triangular or square pitch and a
bundle crossflow area.

### Thermal Analysis

LMTD and $\mathcal{E}$-NTU methods were used to calculate the heat
transfer rate from the mass flow rates found in the hydraulic analysis.
Both methods require an overall heat transfer value $HA$ which is
calculated from tube geometry, film heat transfer coefficients and tube
conductivity. Kerns method is used to calculate the shell side film heat
transfer coefficient $h_o$ from terms defined in the hydraulic analysis.

### $$\mathcal{E}$$-NTU

The $$\mathcal{E}$$-NTU method is used to calculate the heat transfer rate
for a wide range of heat exchanger configurations. The effectiveness can
be found from a dimensionless number of \"transfer units\" denoted $$NTU$$
and a heat capacity rate ratio, $$C^*$$ or $$R$$.
The $$\mathcal{E}$$-NTU method changes when the shell fluid is minimum or
maximum heat capacity rate. A generalised method known as P-NTU defines
a temperature effectiveness $$P$$ as a function of NTU and a ratio of heat
capacity rates $$R$$ both defined below.

$$
NTU = \frac{HA}{C_{\text{min}}} \quad , \quad R_1 = \frac{C_1}{C_2} \quad , \quad P_1 = \frac{C_\text{min}}{C_1} \mathcal{E} = f(NTU, R_1)
$$

Extensive work has been done to find functions, $$f$$, for various heat
exchanger configurations to calculate $$P$$, and hence $$\mathcal{E}$$
[1]. This can then used to obtain outlet temperatures and
heat transfer rate $$\dot{Q}$$.

#### LMTD

The Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) method is based on the
analytical solution for a single stage counterflow heat exchanger. For a
general heat exchanger, a correction factor $F$ is applied which
represents the deviation from counterflow log mean temperature
difference.

$$
\dot{Q} = HAF \Delta T_{\text{lm}} \quad \text{where} \quad \Delta T_{\text{lm}} = \frac{\Delta T_1 - \Delta T_2}{\ln(\Delta T_1 / \Delta T_2)}
$$

For this counterflow definition of F,
$$\Delta T_1 = T_{\text{hot,in}} - T_{\text{cold,out}}$$ and
$$\Delta T_2 = T_{\text{hot,out}} - T_{\text{cold,in}}$$. Variations from
this, including the coflow case or multiple passes, require the F factor
to be calculated from the P-NTU temperature effectiveness, $$P_1$$, and
heat capacity rate ratio $$R_1$$ from well defined relations
[1].

## Optimization Problem

The goal is to maximise the heat transfer rate $$\dot{Q}$$ subject to
physical constraints.
Many standard physical quantities are constrained to discrete values and
standards, such as the number of tubes, baffles and tube diameters. For
our design, we have the following constraints:

-   Total mass of the heat exchanger $$ M < 1.2 $$ Kg.

-   Total length of the heat exchanger $$ L_{\text{total}} < 0.35 $$ m.

-   Total length of the tubes $$ \sum L_{\text{tube}} < 3.5 $$ m.

-   Tubes have outer and inner diameters, $$ d_{o} = 8 $$ mm, and
    $d_{i} = 6$ mm.

-   Shell has inner diameter $$ D_{\text{shell}} = 64 $$ mm.

-   Nozzles must not be closer than $$ 20 $$ mm to the edge of the shell or
    header end.

-   The tube pitch must be greater than $$ 12 $$ mm.

The mass calculation has a level of uncertainty in the manufactured
components and so the constraint is reduced to 1.1 kg. The total length
of the tubes constraint must be modified to account for the
manufacturing process. For $$ n_t $$ total tubes, $$ n_t - 1 $$ cuts with a
blade thickness of $$ 1.5 mm $$ are required and so the actual maximum
length is given below.
$$\sum L_\text{tube} < 3.5 - 0.0015 \times (n_t - 1)$$ The tube lengths
are also limited by the maximum length of the heat exchanger, $0.35$ m.
The nozzle width is 40 mm, however, if there is an even number of hot
sections then the nozzles are on the same side so the opposite end
section can be shortened. This can allow a longer maximum tube length
than an odd number of hot passes.
$$L_\text{tube} < 0.29 - 0.02 \times ( N_{hot}\mod 2)$$ Additional
constraints were also imposed to reduce the search space and simplify
the problem.

The number of baffles was constrained to 8 in the cold fluid path. This
was also to prevent the baffle spacing to become small relative to the
shell diameter and cause further innacuracies in Kerns method.

The number of tubes was constrained to not decrease over the hot fluid
path inside the heat exchanger. This should not exclude the global
optimium because increasing the area at regions of smaller temperature
difference increases overall heat transfer. For example, if we allowed
the area to decrease then more heat transfer would occur in the first
stage, however there would be a significant reduction of heat transfer
in the later stages from both reduced area and temperature difference.

### Algorithms

Three optimization algorithms were tested: Brute force, Sequential Least
Squares Programming, and Simplicial Homology Global Optimization.
The Simplicial Homology Global Optimization algorithm was chosen for its
robustness and ability to find optima in all cases. SHGO is a
derivative-free global optimization algorithm that efficiently
subdivides the search space into smaller regions (simplicial complexes)
to find the global optimum [3].

## Software

### Implementation

The Python application used PyQt6 and matplotlib for the GUI. The
calculations were done using NumPy and SciPy libraries. The software
tool allows the user to interactively change the design parameters for a
wide range of heat exchanger configurations. Calculated values are
displayed in real-time and the user can compare the performance of
different designs. 
The software features object oriented design with classes for the heat
exchanger and fluid path components. The structure is designed to easily
modify fluid properties and introduce new flow components. Seperate
optimization threads are used to prevent the GUI from freezing during
long calculations. A log displays optimization progress, warning and
error messages. There is also a diagram of the heat exchanger which
helps the user visualise the flow path of multi-stage designs.

*Optimized Designs for a variety of heat exchanger configurations, with the limiting constraint in bold.*

It was interesting to see that the software tool was finding longer
solutions with additional tubes in later hot passes over shorter designs
with an equal number of tubes in each hot pass. However, this design
with a different number of tubes in each section is much harder to
manufacture than a circularly symmetric design.

From table [1](#table:designs){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:designs"} the yellow row shows the optimal design
predicted by the software has 1 cold stage and 3 hot stages. This was
the design proposed by our pair and selected by the group. During the
development of CAD, slight modifications were made and checked with the
software tool. A slightly shorter 5,5,5 tube configuration was used for
circular and axial symmetry, reducing the number of unique components
and simplifying the manufacturing process. The group also decided to
reduce the number of baffles to 7. This may have been out of concern
that the baffle spacing would become too small relative to the shell
diameter. There are also practical reasons for having an odd number of
baffles, as the cold inlet and outlet nozzles are on the same side of
the shell.

## Software Summary

Hydraulic analysis was performed using Kerns method and compared with
experimental data. Innacuracies in the method were identified for the
cold flow path and improved by a linear fit to the pressure calculation.
$$\mathcal{E}$$-NTU and LMTD methods were compared by calculation time,
with $$\mathcal{E}$$-NTU being 2-2.5 times faster on average. Calculated
heat transfer rates showed a strong correlation of $$\mathbf{0.91772}$$ to
experimentally measured values for a range of heat exchanger designs. An
interactive software tool was developed to rapidly test a wide range of
heat exchanger configurations and compare performance. Common mass and
geometry specification constraints were considered with further
constraints to reduce the search space. Three algorithms for finding an
optimal design were compared and SHGO was chosen for its robustness and
ability to find optima in all cases. Various heat exchanger
configurations were optimised for which were limited by different
constraints. The highest heat transfer design with 1 cold stage and 3
hot stages was selected and small design modifications were made for
manufacturability.

## Performance degredation

Performance degredation due to fouling is also considered but only the results are shown here.

## Performance Comparison

There were small modifications made to the software for some groups unique designs.

## Uncertainty

The following is significantly simplified from the report.

Uncertainty in heat transfer rate was propagated from a central difference derivative.
Uncertainty in pitch was estimated from the difference in calculated and a \"true average\" value.
The values $$u_\text{cold}(\dot{Q})$$ and $$u_\text{hot}(\dot{Q})$$ represent uncertainty over the whole compressor characteristics.
The uncertainty in the fit to previous data is also considered with a 90\% confidence interval.

The performance of the 2024 designs is shown in figure
[3](#fig:2024_performance){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:2024_performance"}. With little confidence, our software
predicts that our design will perform the best out of all groups. It can
also be seen that despite small manufacturing modifications made to our
design, it is still close to the optimal found. Group C's design was
predicted to come 2nd with a heat transfer 0.28% below our design. Their
design was calculated to be much heavier at 1.145 kg, which does not
accurately include the weight of the manifold. A seperate optimisation
was performed with a relaxed mass constraint, which agreed that group
C's design was the closest to optimal. In third place was group A, with
a heat transfer 1.97% below our design. This was 1.34 % below predicted
optimal for their configuration. Groups B and D were predicted at 4th
and 5th place respectively, with heat transfers 4.15% and 4.44% below
our design. These were also 3.53% and 3.82% below predicted optimal for
their configurations.

## Group results 

![$\dot{Q}$ results](/assets/img/projects/heat_exchanger/2024_results.png){#fig:Qdot_results width="60%"}

Figure [3](#fig:Qdot_results){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Qdot_results"} shows the experimental results for the
heat exchanger performance of each group. Group D's heat exchanger
performed the best at 14.77 kW, exceeding our calculated value by 8.7%,
but within the uncertainty band of 12.69%. Our group E heat exchanger
had the second best performance 9.7% below that of Group D, and 6.2%
below our calculated value. The remaining groups ranked C, A and then B
at 16.5%, 19.9% and 26.3% below group D, which is the same order
predicted by our software. Figure
[3](#fig:Qdot_results){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Qdot_results"} also shows that these last 3 groups are
outside of the uncertainty bands with experimental values being -13.0%,
-15.1% and -20.1% below the respective calculated values.

## Design recommendations

An odd number of hot passes, with more counterflow passes than coflow
passes, has a slightly better effectiveness than an even number of hot
passes with an equal number of coflow and counterflow. Textbooks state
these uncommon designs may result in structural and thermal problems
[@HeatTransfer]. However for this application of compact heat
exchangers, the lengths and operating temperature gradients are small so
thermal expansion is negligible. An additional hot pass comes at a cost
of increased pressure drop compared to a smaller number of even hot
passes, however the increased effectiveness was found to be worth the
tradeoff.

Tube count, position and length are the most important factors in
determining the heat exchanger performance. Increasing heat transfer
area will generally increase the heat transfer rate and can be done by
increasing tube count or length. However this needs to be done carefully
as increasing the length increases the hot side pressure drop,
increasing tube count reduces hot side pressure drop but increases cold
side pressure drop. The software also recommended longer designs with more
tubes in later hot passes over shorter designs with an equal number of
tubes in each hot pass. This is because increasing the heat transfer
area at regions of smaller temperature differences increases the overall
heat transfer.

Increasing baffles increases the cold side pressure drop, decreasing the
mass flow rate, however, it also increases the shell side Nusselt
number, and therefore the overall heat transfer coefficient. For a given
design there is a point at which the increased heat transfer coefficient
is outweighed by the reduction in mass flow rate. Kerns method seemed to
overestimate this optimal number of baffles, selecting designs with
$\sim20$ baffles. This makes it difficult to recommend this method for
selecting the optimal number of baffles and a more detailed
Bell-Delaware method should be considered instead. Our group chose to
add a constraint such that the baffle spacing was more than half the
shell diameter, however due to thickness and nozzle placement, the
actual baffle spacing was reduced.

# Conclusion

The development of heat exchanger design software provided valuable
insights into heat exchangers. Group D's heat exchanger showed the best
performance, exceeding our calculated value by 8.7%, while our design
ranked second, performing 6.2% below expectation. The software correctly
predicted the performance order of the remaining groups, although their
experimental values fell outside the uncertainty bands. The
discrepancies between the calculated and experimental results can be
attributed to various factors, such as the limitations of Kern's method
in estimating shell-side pressure drop, unforeseen assembly issues, and
leaks in some heat exchangers. Recommendations were made for numerous
design configurations and a software tool can be modified to set unique
or additional constraints for a variety of applications. Future work is
discussed which includes implementing the Bell-Delaware method for more
accurate shell-side pressure drop calculations and additional
constraints and design considerations.
