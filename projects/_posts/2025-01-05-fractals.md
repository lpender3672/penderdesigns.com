Shader art generated from modified shader code originally written by CodeParade in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ).
My modifications, which include adding a double pendulum (time to flip) fractal, can be seen on github [here](https://github.com/lpender3672/FractalExplorer).

Fractals are amazing because very beautiful and complex shapes can be generated from very simple equations.
I originally implemented the double pendulum fractal (seen below) in 2nd year of University as part of an extension question on the double pendulum lab sheet.

Its important to note that the fractal doesnt have as much detail close to the border between colour and black when compared to, for example, Mandelbrot as more simulation time is needed to accurately tell if the pendulum flips or not.
This simulation time was limited to keep the application responsive in real time as it was run on shaders.
